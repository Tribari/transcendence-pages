# transcendence-pages

## How it works
You should read more about Twig-Compiler first.
* Map your domain to the /public folder.
* Create your partials (like navbar eg.) as twig-files in the /partials folder
* You html-base should be located in the /templates folder
* Create your pages as html-files in the /pages folder
* Subpages go to a subfolder in /pages
* Stylesheets and Javascript files are located in /public/style. You can work with Less files!
